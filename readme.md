# Unit Test Builder POC

This is a POC that allows running EDK2 host based unit tests on Windows 10.  Eventually this capability will be moved into the mu_build system.  

<aside class="notice">
Make sure you run `pip install --upgrade -r pip_requirements.txt` as a new feature is used from MuEnvironment 0.3.11

## Running the tests

Run **UnitTestBuild.py** from the command window.
