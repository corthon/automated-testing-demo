# Unit Test Builder POC

This is a POC that allows running EDK2 host based unit tests on Windows 10.  Eventually this capability will be moved into the mu_build system.  

## Prereq
Make sure you run pip to update to MuEnvironment 0.3.11

```cmd
pip install --upgrade -r pip_requirements.txt
``` 

## Running the tests

Run **UnitTestBuild.py** from the command window.
